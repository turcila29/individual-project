Welcome to FRAGRANCE WORLD


## 1. Project Overview


In this file I will present the beautiful journey of how Fragrance World was created.
1. Technologies used:

 
I have used the following technologies in my project:

 

1. Kanban (via Jira) for project management and agile framework
2. Git as the version control system
3. GitHub for source code management
4. HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap for front-end development
5. Python as the back-end programming language
6. Flask as the API development platform
7. MySQL as the database management system

 
    This was the phase where I sat myself down and really thought about what it means to "build a website".
Therefore, I started breaking everything down into smaller tasks, and those smaller tasks into even smaller tasks until I got to the bottom of it.

 

## 2. How I used Agile Methodology


I thought that the best way of approaching this project was through Agile Methodology. Therefore, I spent about 15 minutes each morning to review and plan what I had to do for the day. Mainly, I took a 15-20 minutes break after every 3 hours of work. Since it was a pretty quick deadline, instead of having 1 week long sprints, I had 2 days long sprints, so after every 2 days I reviewed and tested the progress made so far and planned my next sprint accordingly.
 
## 3. How I used my Kanban board


### Epics, User Stories, Tasks and Acceptance Criteria

I created 9 user stories that covered the must ares of my project, including the home page, cart page, payment, shipping, and so on. Inside each of my user stories, I stored all of the related tasks to keep it well-structured and easy to understand. This is the first draft of the Kanban:

And as I progressed through the project I was also moving around my tasks so I know where I stand and how much I got left to do.

And eventually, it was all done:

I also included some risks which I put in my risk assessment in the next section.

### Risk Assessment

This displays some of the risks that I may have encountered during the project, including the steps to mitigate any negative impacts. Based on this risk assessment, I was able to make changed to my code to decrease the possibility of the risks happening.
